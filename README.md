🦠 The Problem: A Deadly Fungal Disease
The fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) infects the skin of Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog (Rana sierrae).

🔬 What the Researchers Studied
They looked at:
How Bd infection affects the frog’s skin microbiome (the community of bacteria living on its skin).

They studied two frog populations:
Epizootic: Likely experienced severe Bd outbreaks in the past
Enzootic: But now still live with Bd at lower, stable levels

The big question:
Are these surviving populations being helped by protective skin bacteria?

🧪 Key Findings:
1️⃣ Highly infected frogs had:
Lower bacterial diversity (fewer types of bacteria)
Very similar microbiomes between individuals (loss of natural variation)
This suggests Bd infection disrupts and simplifies the normal microbial community.

2️⃣ One bacterial group dominates in sick frogs
In heavily infected frogs:
Over 90% of bacteria belonged to a single group: Burkholderiales
In less infected frogs, this group made up only 54%
This means infection strongly shifts the microbial balance.

3️⃣ Some bacteria can inhibit Bd

Some skin bacteria may actively fight the fungus.
These bacteria could potentially be used as probiotics for frogs.

🌍 Why This Matters
This study shows:
- Bd infection doesn’t just infect frogs, it reshapes their entire skin ecosystem.
- Certain bacteria may help frogs survive ongoing infections.
- There may be potential to develop anti-Bd probiotic treatments to protect endangered frogs.
